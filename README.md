# activity15-github-practice
Repo for Activity 15:

This repository is for Activity 14 and Activity 15. It shows that I can use GitHub the right way, including making branches, issues, commits, pull requests, and organizing files. Everything  related to Activity 14 is stored here.

What's in This Repo:

In this repo, you’ll see the PDF I turned in for Activity 14 and the QMD file I used to make it. I also made a second branch where I did some updates before bringing them back into the main branch. I added a couple of issues and a pull request so you can see the steps I took. This README is just here to explain what’s inside.

My Plan:

My plan for keeping this repo organized was pretty simple. I made it public, kept the main branch clean, and did my edits on another branch. If something needed to be fixed, I made an issue for it. I tried to write clear commit messages so it’s easy to understand what I changed. Then I used a pull request to merge everything back into the main branch.

Activity 14:

For Activity 14, my plan was to upload the PDF and QMD, label everything clearly, and update this README so everything makes sense. I committed all my changes and used the GitHub tools we learned so everything is easy to follow.
